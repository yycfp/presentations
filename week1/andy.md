## Andy's Slides

Functional programming can be daunting, but remember that it isn’t only for PhDs, data scientists and architecture astronauts. For most of us, the real benefit of adopting a functional style is that our programs can be broken down into smaller, simpler pieces that are both more reliable and easier to understand.

1. Welcome to Function Programmers YYC!
    * Introductions
    * Why did we create the group?
        * Thank everyone for coming
        * What does the community want?
    * What is FP?
        * Based on a simple premise with far-reaching implications: we construct our programs using only pure functions—in other words, functions that have no side effects. Think "a series of transformations".
        * immutable & stateless (reasoning)
        * higher-order function (reusability)
        * ADT (compiler, correctness)
        * laziness (generators, think infinite list of primes)
            *  The Internet is inherently lazy. Imagine that when you visit a page on a server, it had to generate all the pages that you can possibly view.
    * Why FP?
        * discuss who in the industry is using FP
        * discuss resurgence
        * did OO fail?
2. Let's dig into the concepts
